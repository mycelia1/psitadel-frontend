      <p>We are a rag-tag group of Bitcoiners, Burners, and general Freaks. We seek to empower individuals by teaching how to employ self-sovereignty over their own mental, spiritual, physical, social, and financial well-being. How? We achieve this through education, and leading by example. See our educational resources and our mission statement to learn more. </p>
